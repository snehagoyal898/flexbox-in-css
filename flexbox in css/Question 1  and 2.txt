Question 1)Describe the main difference between CSS flexbox layout model and CSS gridbox layout model.When would you choose to use one over the other?

Solution:The basic difference between CSS grid layout and CSS flexbox layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either horizontally or vertically. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.
We will use flexbox when we have to align items in a single axis like in navbars,card designs,menus etc.
We will use gridbox when we have to align items in two axes at the same time like galleries,magazine layouts and forms with multiple fields etc.

Question 2) Explain the role of the following key properties in the CSS flexbox layout model.
Solution)
a)justify-content-- This defines the alignment along the main axis.
b)align-items--This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line.
c)gap--This is used to define gap between flex items in both axes.
d)flex-direction--The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.
e)flex-wrap--The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.
